        <br>
        <br>
        1. Demonstrate and communicate aesthetic skills and choices based on traditional art theories and current game 
        development practices and next generation research.<br><br>

        Paragraph of how I did this.<br><br><br>

        2. Conceptualize and generate pre-production art assets through pre-visualization and prototypes usable for multiple game 
        platforms.<br><br>

        Paragraph of how I did this.<br><br><br>

        3. Demonstrate the core skills needed to create 2D and 3D art assets, textures, and animations utilizing industry-standard 
        software tools.<br><br>

        Paragraph of how I did this.<br><br><br>

        4. Create industry quality 2D and 3D art assets (such as characters, props, textures, environment elements, and collision 
        objects) or animations (keyframed and motion capture character, environmental and FX) for use in game projects utilizing 
        industry-standard software tools, pipelines, and platform guidelines.<br><br>

        Paragraph of how I did this.<br><br><br>

        5. Adapt, export, integrate, and optimize game art and animation assets (including shaders and lighting) into 2D and 3D 
        game projects working within a production pipeline and the confines of a projectâ€™s game engine, tools and other 
        constraints. <br><br>

        Paragraph of how I did this.<br><br><br>

        6. Establish collaboration, mentorship, and professional leadership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly
